# Financial Access in South Asia

Sarah Hussain

## Description

Through this project, I explore key indicators of financial inclusion using the World Bank’s Global Findex dataset. The analysis focuses on account ownership (through banks and mobile money), savings, and financial resilience—areas critical for policymakers in low-income countries where many lack access to formal and digital financial services. This allows for a deeper understanding of the state of financial access and the gaps in account ownership by gender, income, and age. Examining saving behaviors provides additional insight into which methods are most effective in South Asia, while measuring financial resilience highlights whether inclusion efforts are truly empowering individuals. Overall, this analysis offers policymakers a snapshot of current access levels—and, by extension, the state of savings and resilience—across South Asia.
